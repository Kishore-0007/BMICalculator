# BMI Calculator
# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented in Java.

## Features

1. **User-friendly Interface**: The application has a clean and minimalist user interface, making it easy for users to input their height and weight.

2. **Height and Weight Input**: Users can input their height (in cm or inches) and weight (in kg or lbs) in the provided text fields.

3. **BMI Calculation**: Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application calculates the BMI using the formula `weight / ((height * height) / 10000)` for metric units or `weight / (height * height) * 703` for imperial units.

4. **Result Display**: The calculated BMI is displayed in the console. The application also provides a general classification of the user's weight status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated BMI.

5. **Input Validation**: The application checks if the input fields are empty or if they contain non-numeric characters, and prompts the user to provide valid inputs if necessary.

## How to Run

To run this application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can run the application by executing the `main` method in the `App` class. The application will run in the console.

Please note that this is a console application and it requires a console environment to run.

## Future Improvements

While this application serves its purpose, there are several improvements that could be made in the future:

- Adding more precise classifications for BMI (e.g., further classifications within "Overweight" like "Obese Class I", "Obese Class II", etc.).
- Implementing a more modern and visually appealing user interface using libraries like JavaFX.
- Adding the ability to save past results for tracking changes over time.

Feel free to contribute to this project and make it better!
